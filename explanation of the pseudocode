This script defines a function called metamorphicMalware that takes an input file and applies metamorphic transformations to it using a neural network to predict whether the transformed file is likely to be detected as malicious by security mechanisms. If the prediction is "malicious", the function exits without executing the transformed file. Otherwise, it executes the transformed file.

The script also defines several other functions including transformFile, which applies a random number of transformations (between 1 and 5) to the input file, chooseRandomTransformation, which selects a random transformation from a list of available transformations, and several example transformation functions such as encrypt, addJunkCode, renameVariables, and changeControlFlow.

Finally, the script includes two use cases: one with a malicious input file and one with a benign input file. In the first use case, the metamorphicMalware function should exit without executing the file, while in the second use case, it should execute the file.
